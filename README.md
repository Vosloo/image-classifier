<h1>Image classifier</h1>
<h3>University project - Deep Learning course</h3>
<br>

The main point of the project was to implement image classifier on the [dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/) using convolutional neural network created with help of Tensorflow framework.

Project description can be found in the [project_description.ipynb](project_description.ipynb) file and the whole model as well as results in [project.ipynb](project.ipynb).
